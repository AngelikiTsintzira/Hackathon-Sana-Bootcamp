# Hackathon-Sana-Bootcamp
The goal was to create within 10 -15 hours a smart mobile or tablet application that will provide health solutions. 
My team and I worked in the expansion of an android application called vida24 from Vidavo. 
This application includes many health solutions, but our main focus was on the pacemaker.
